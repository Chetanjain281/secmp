## üéØ IMPORTANT CONTEXT FOR NEW COPILOT INSTANCES

### **Project Unique Requirements**
1. **HNI Focus**: This is not a retail trading platform - designed for high net worth individuals
2. **POC Nature**: Prioritize functionality over production optimizations
3. **Suitability Matching**: Critical feature - investors can only trade eligible funds
4. **Custody Tracking**: Must track real-world asset backing for each fund
5. **Dual Market Types**: Primary (NAV-based) and Secondary (custom pricing)
6. **Waiting Lists**: Partial order handling is essential for user experience

### **Technical Constraints**
1. **No JWT**: Keep authentication simple with sessions
2. **Mock Everything**: Payment gateways, document uploads, regulatory checks
3. **Real-time Events**: Everything must flow through Kafka
4. **Visual Payment Flow**: INR‚ÜíUSD‚ÜíUSDC conversion must be visualized
5. **Marketplace Locking**: Tokens locked in smart contract, not user approval pattern
6. **üî¥ WINDOWS POWERSHELL**: Always use `;` instead of `&&` for chaining terminal commands

### **Development Priorities**
1. **Backend First**: Complete all backend services before frontend
2. **Test Everything**: Each component must be testable via HTML dashboard
3. **Event Visualization**: Kafka events must be visible in real-time
4. **Documentation**: Every decision must be logged for context

### **Key Files & Locations**
- **Main Plan**: `docs/PLAN.md` - Complete development roadmap
- **This File**: `docs/PROMPTSANDLOGS.md` - All context and progress
- **README**: `README.md` - Project overview and setup
- **Smart Contracts**: `contracts/` - All Solidity files
- **Microservices**: `backend/` - Each service in separate folder
- **Visualization**: `kafka-viz/` - Real-time event dashboard

### **Critical Business Rules**
1. **Suitability is binary**: Pass/fail, no scoring
2. **Partial orders create waiting lists**: Don't cancel, queue remainder
3. **Secondary pricing is free**: Investors set their own prices
4. **All events are logged**: Everything goes through Kafka
5. **Admin approves everything**: KYB, funds, major actions
